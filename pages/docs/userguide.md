# ZooKeeper User Guide

In this guide, we will explain how to use ZooKeeper.

## Getting started



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3038/0*pspor8F9f8Oqr8Nn)

Before you start, you’ll need one of the three wallets Zookeeper supports:

* WanMask (Desktop)

* Wanwallet (Desktop/Mobile)

* Coming Soon: MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile) late APRIL 2021

The purpose of ZooKeeper is to work alongside Wanswap and bring liquidity to the Wanchain ecosystem. You’ll only be able to benefit from ZooKeeper if you have provided liquidity to the Wanswap Liquidity Pools and obtained WSLP (Wanswap Liquidity Provider) tokens. You can find both written and video guides on how to do this here:

* The following video starts at 1:12, watch until 3:02 (At this point, you will have WSLP tokens): [https://youtu.be/zFcLUGqNck8?t=72](https://youtu.be/zFcLUGqNck8?t=72).

* Follow the Liquidity Pool Staking instructions in this medium document: [https://medium.com/wanswap/how-to-use-wanswap-f80e206827d6](https://medium.com/wanswap/how-to-use-wanswap-f80e206827d6)

Once you have a compatible wallet and WSLP tokens, you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.

There are four essential areas in ZooKeeper. They are as follows:

* The Zoo

* The Expedition

* The Market

* My Safe

## The Zoo

The Zoo is the main area you see when loading up the Dapp.

## A Pool Explained

This is how a pool looks, you can see the explanation for each section by checking the text that matches the numbers.

1. There will be many pools, and each will have a mascot. Each mascot will have a name associated with it. You may see a speech bubble next to the mascot, highlighting the unique features within the pool.

1. On the right of the ZooKeeper icon, the current multiplier (i.e. for ZOO rewards) for that specific pool will be displayed.

1. The APY will display the Annual Percentage Yield of the pool to that particular time. It is worth noting that the APY is subject to change as each block passes.

1. The next section of the pool information displays how many tokens you have earned with the currently locked liquidity. If you haven’t provided any liquidity or removed liquidity from the pool, this will show as “0.00”.

1. On the right of the earned tokens, you’ll see a “Harvest” button. If you have no liquidity in the pool, this will be inactive; however, once your allocation of liquidity has been successful, you can claim your mining reward at any time.

1. Next, you will see the value of the WSLP tokens you have provided. The amount will fluctuate during the time the liquidity is locked in the ZooKeeper pool. If you have no liquidity, this will display as “$ — “.

1. Under the locked value of your WSLP, you can either choose to deposit WSLP for the first time or, if you have already contributed to the pool, you can add more WSLP to your current stake. Selecting either “Deposit WSLP Token” or “Top-Up” will provide more options to help you enhance your rewards. These are detailed further below.

1. Next, you’ll see the Token pairings. You will need to have provided liquidity into the pool before you can start farming the ZOO token. A link next to the token pair will direct you to the Wanswap Dapp, where obtaining WSLP is possible.

7A. If you are depositing for the first time in a pool, you’ll be able to select the number of days you would like to lock up your WSLP. Once locked, you will be unable to remove your WSLP, so choose this period wisely. The more days you choose to lock up the WSLP, the greater the Boost %.

7B. If you are topping up a pool you have already contributed to, you can optionally increase the boost %. By changing this, the number of days in the lock period will increase.

7C. If you are adding WSLP for the first time, one of the many great main features ZooKeeper has when contributing to a pool is the ability to provide an “extra boost” to your rewards with NFT boosters (See NFT section for more info). These can also reduce the time your WSLP is locked.

7D. You will also be able to switch your NFT Booster for another if you wish to do so at any point.

7E. Once any WSLP has been added/topped up or has had an NFT added/swapped, it’s essential to confirm these actions with the Approve and Validate actions.

It’s worth pointing out that when you add WSLP to a pool, you’ll notice three subtle changes to the mascot card.

1. The card will have a glowing border around it.

1. The mascot will be wearing shades.

1. The comment bubble will either change or appear to display further options to increase yield or display the NFT image you have assigned.

## Filtering:

You’ll notice the handy filtering options will enable you to find pools with the most liquidity or the most significant multipliers, view the pools you’ve contributed to, and which pools are currently active.

## The Expedition

The expedition page displays multiple ways to spend or stake ZOO tokens to obtain a “Chest”. There are two types of chests, Gold and Silver.

No matter how you manage to obtain it, a gold chest will always contain an NFT Booster.

A silver chest, however, will have a 1 in 10 chance of winning an NFT Booster. If you manage to get an NFT from a silver chest, it *will not be* of the class you would get from a gold chest.

**Buy Gold/Silver Chests:**



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*PhkE2FcqvYuJtfVh)

The option to purchase chests is self-explanatory. You can buy one of either at a time. If an NFT Booster is awarded (remember, silver has a 1 in 10 chance), Purchasing will automatically open and add the NFT Booster to “My Safe”.

**Staking ZOO for Gold Chest:**



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wKqV-6ohAhJhX9vs)

The alternative option to obtain an NFT Booster is by locking up your ZOO tokens for a set amount of time:

* 48 Hours

* 15 Days

* 30 Days

Once you have staked your ZOO tokens, a countdown timer will be visible, displaying the remaining time left until you can claim the gold chest.

## The Market



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2484/0*t97iIc1oJk1o_u41)

The Market is a place where you can buy NFT Boosters that other ZooKeeper users want to sell. Users can purchase boosters with an array of different wan tokens (The amount shown is what the seller is asking for and is explained later in the “My Safe” section).

Again, users can choose many different filtering types on the list of available boosters and display only those available that meet the users’ requirements more precisely.

## My Safe



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2500/0*Hp-qlN1GHgUyGA4c)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/NaN/undefined)

My Safe is an area where your NFT boosters (that have not been utilized in a pool) will reside. Not only will you be able to view the potential these boosters can bring to your WSLP farming pools, but this view will also provide the opportunity for you to sell any unwanted boosters.

Similar filtering options to “The Market” are available here and, your transaction history can be viewed and filtered. The page will display how many boosters you own and have in “My Safe”.

Each booster will display its associated features, and when hovering over (in card view), you’ll see the “sell” button. Immediately on the left of the sell button, you can input the value you wish to sell for, as well as which wan token you will receive upon a successful sale.

Boosters for sale will be identifiable by a large yellow box in the card’s bottom right.

## ZOO Info panel



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Z2Ft89RN5QKDT7s5)

This section simply displays a brief description of the distribution, market cap, and value of the $ZOO token.

## ZOO Burn panel



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NPVeF2Gq4GOWw8kR)

ZooKeeper has a burn mechanism. The burn happens each time a chest is purchased. For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, The burning mechanism would immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens.

## ZooKeeper NFT Information

ZooKeeper NFT’s defined by many key features. Each NFT minted will have its own individual characteristics. Some may be the same as others, and some will vary. For example, no “Sweet Scented Orange” will be the same:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/NaN/0*14y1GfICxmpyLdaA)

As you can see from the above, the boosting impact and the time impact are different. Even on the off chance that these should be the same, each NFT will have its issue number, making it unique.

When NFTs are minted, the key features which define them will not change. Boosting and time percentages will not change at any time.

## Level

Levels will make more sense when crafting becomes available. Crafting will provide a mechanism to be able to combine 2 NFT’s to create one. An example of this would be 2 x Apples (2 x 1 stars) = 1 x Apple Juice (1 x 2 star). This will be possible up to a maximum of 4 levels (One Star, Two Star, Three Star, and Max). More details on this will be provided closer to release time.

## Class

N — Normal

R — Rare

SR — Super Rare

SSR — Super Super Rare

UR — Ultra Rare

## More About WSLP tokens

The tokens used for staking in a pool are **WSLP **(**W**an **S**wap **L**iquidity **P**rovider) tokens. You obtain WSLP tokens by providing liquidity to a pair on WanSwap. The WSLP tokens represent your share in that pool, you could see them as a voucher which returns your provided liquidity to you when you withdraw from the liquidity pair, the WSLP tokens will be burned when withdrawing. The tokens also hold the earned fees you get from all the transactions done on that pair, 0.25% of each transaction is divided over the liquidity providers in the pool, depending on your share in that pool, so if your share in the pool is 10% you get 10% of the 0.25% fee. In addition to the fees, you can also deposit the WSLP tokens into farming and earn extra rewards, these rewards are paid in WASP. ZooKeeper will bring even more incentive for staking your WSLP tokens.
