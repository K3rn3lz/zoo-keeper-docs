# USER MANUAL



## Getting Started

Before you start, you’ll need one of the three wallets ZooKeeper supports:

* WanMask (Desktop)

* Wanwallet (Desktop/Mobile)

* Coming Soon: MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile) late APRIL 2021

Once you have a compatible wallet and WSLP tokens (check the FAQ on how to provide liquidity on WanSwap), you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.

## A Pool Explained

This is how a pool looks, you can see the explanation for each section by checking the text that matches the numbers.

1. There will be many pools, and each will have a mascot. Each mascot will have a name associated with it. You may see a speech bubble next to the mascot, highlighting the unique features within the pool.

1. On the right of the ZooKeeper icon, the current multiplier (i.e. for ZOO rewards) for that specific pool will be displayed.

1. The APY will display the Annual Percentage Yield of the pool to that particular time. It is worth noting that the APY is subject to change as each block passes.

1. The next section of the pool information displays how many tokens you have earned with the currently locked liquidity. If you haven’t provided any liquidity or removed liquidity from the pool, this will show as “0.00”.

1. On the right of the earned tokens, you’ll see a “Harvest” button. If you have no liquidity in the pool, this will be inactive; however, once your allocation of liquidity has been successful, you can claim your mining reward at any time.

1. Next, you will see the value of the WSLP tokens you have provided. The amount will fluctuate during the time the liquidity is locked in the ZooKeeper pool. If you have no liquidity, this will display as “$ — “.

1. Under the locked value of your WSLP, you can either choose to deposit WSLP for the first time or, if you have already contributed to the pool, you can add more WSLP to your current stake. Selecting either “Deposit WSLP Token” or “Top-Up” will provide more options to help you enhance your rewards. These are detailed further below.

1. Next, you’ll see the Token pairings. You will need to have provided liquidity into the pool before you can start farming the ZOO token. A link next to the token pair will direct you to the Wanswap Dapp, where obtaining WSLP is possible.

7A. If you are depositing for the first time in a pool, you’ll be able to select the number of days you would like to lock up your WSLP. Once locked, you will be unable to remove your WSLP, so choose this period wisely. The more days you choose to lock up the WSLP, the greater the Boost %.

7B. If you are topping up a pool you have already contributed to, you can optionally increase the boost %. By changing this, the number of days in the lock period will increase.

7C. If you are adding WSLP for the first time, one of the many great main features ZooKeeper has when contributing to a pool is the ability to provide an “extra boost” to your rewards with NFT boosters (See NFT section for more info). These can also reduce the time your WSLP is locked.

7D. You will also be able to switch your NFT Booster for another if you wish to do so at any point.

7E. Once any WSLP has been added/topped up or has had an NFT added/swapped, it’s essential to confirm these actions with the Approve and Validate actions.

It’s worth pointing out that when you add WSLP to a pool, you’ll notice three subtle changes to the mascot card.

1. The card will have a glowing border around it.

1. The mascot will be wearing shades.

1. The comment bubble will either change or appear to display further options to increase yield or display the NFT image you have assigned.Filtering

You’ll notice the handy filtering options will enable you to find pools with the most liquidity or the most significant multipliers, view the pools you’ve contributed to, and which pools are currently active.

## The Expedition

The expedition page displays multiple ways to spend or stake ZOO tokens to obtain a “Chest”. There are two types of chests: Gold and Silver.

No matter how you manage to obtain it, a gold chest will always contain an NFT Booster.

A silver chest, however, will have a 1 in 10 chance of winning an NFT Booster. If you manage to get an NFT from a silver chest, it will not be of the class you would get from a gold chest.

**Buy Gold/Silver Chests:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Ufh6acvSOgjiazEQ)

The option to purchase chests is self-explanatory. You can buy one of either at a time. If an NFT Booster is awarded (remember, silver has a 1 in 10 chance), purchasing will automatically open and add the NFT Booster card to “My Safe”.

**Staking ZOO for a Gold Chest:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0J9wHsbZZ9n31V1i)

The alternative option to obtain an NFT Booster is by locking up your ZOO tokens for a set amount of time:

* 2 Days

* 15 Days

* 30 Days

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*eqVUYrwc3dtt0yBs)

Once you have staked your ZOO tokens, a countdown timer will be visible, displaying the remaining time left until you can claim the gold chest.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*V7h5wvmsPqgWkIzQ)

## Dynamic Pricing Mechanics

Chest prices are set dynamically with a decrease of 1% in price every hour (no chest purchases) and increase of 1% every time a chest is bought, or when ZOO tokens are staked.

Price Rules:

1 Silver Chest costs 10 times less than a Gold Chest.

To receive 1 Gold Chest from staking ZOO tokens:

* 2 days of lock = the amount of ZOO needed to stake is 10 times the current price of a Gold Chest

* 15 days lock = the amount of ZOO needed to stake is the current price of 1 Gold Chest

* 30 days lock = the amount of ZOO needed to stake is 5 times the current price of a Silver Chest

## The Market

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2484/0*xfRQGY_uLLBjZelz)

The Market is a place where you can buy NFT Boosters that other ZooKeeper users want to sell. Users can purchase boosters with an array of different wan tokens (The amount shown is what the seller is asking for and is explained later in the “My Safe” section).

Again, users can choose many different filtering types on the list of available boosters and display only those available that meet the users’ requirements more precisely.

**Selling an NFT**

* Go to My Safe

* Hoover over the NFT you want to sell with your mouse

## My Safe

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2500/0*HkQ0PprDNq-JCNRx)

My Safe is an area where your NFT boosters (that have not been utilised in a pool) will reside. Not only will you be able to view the potential these boosters can bring to your WSLP farming pools, but this view will also provide the opportunity for you to sell any unwanted boosters.

Similar filtering options to “The Market” are available here and your transaction history can be viewed and filtered. The page will display how many boosters you own and have in “My Safe”.

Each booster will display its associated features, and when hovering over (in card view), you’ll see the “sell” button. Right to the left of the sell button you can input the value you wish to sell for, as well as which wan token you will receive upon a successful sale.

Boosters for sale will be identifiable by a large yellow box in the card’s bottom right.

## ZOO Info panel

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*dzl9R3QB08eU9Csm)

This section simply displays a brief description of the distribution, market cap and value of the $ZOO token.

## ZOO Burn panel

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Dy0bPY9b8T0vjw_0)

ZooKeeper has a burn mechanism. The burn happens every time a chest is purchased. For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, the burning mechanism will immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens.

## ZooKeeper NFT Information;

ZooKeeper NFT’s are defined by many key features. Each minted NFT will have its own individual characteristics. Some may be the same as others, and some will vary. For example, no two “Sweet Scented Orange” will be the same:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*mt6uFnJ0mUAFqSt0)

As you can see from the above, the boosting impact and the locktime reducing impact are different. Even on the off chance that these should be the same, each NFT will have its individual issue number, making it unique.

When NFTs are minted, the key features which define them will not change. Boosting and time percentages will not change at any time.

## Level

Levels will make more sense when crafting becomes available. Crafting will provide a mechanism to be able to combine 2 NFTs to create one. An example of this would be 2 x Apples (2 x 1 stars) = 1 x Apple Juice (1 x 2 star). This will be possible upto a maximum of 4 levels (One Star, Two Star, Three Star and Max). More details on this will be provided closer to release time.

This is the original vision of ZooKeeper team in regards to the level system; more developments will be implemented in the future and changes can be made to the mechanics of this section.

## Class

N — Normal

R — Rare

SR — Super Rare

SSR — Super Super Rare
