# Governance Proposal Rules

Proposals consist of a 3-5 day voting period where the community will submit votes. There are two proposal categories: those initiated by the team, and those initiated by the community. 


## Team Proposals

Team proposals require a 50% approval from the community and 20% of eligible votes (circulating supply), this means that all addresses that voted need to account for at least 10% of the total circulating supply



## Community Proposals

Proposing governance actions requires you to hold at least 0.2% of the circulating ZOO supply on your address. Once a governance proposal has been initiated, the team will need to confirm if implementing the proposal is technically possible, regardless of the team's opinion on the proposal (the technical justification must be shared with the proposal creator, and the community if necessary). Once the technicalities have been confirmed, the voting can begin. In order for the proposal to pass, it requires a 55% approval from the community and 10% of eligible votes (circulating supply).


Once a proposal has passed, it will be implemented shortly after. To initiate a proposal, head over to https://vote.wandevs.org/#/zboob

_Note:_ _In a scenario where more than one technical implementation is required, this will be addressed on a first-come, first-served basis._
