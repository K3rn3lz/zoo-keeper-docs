## Dual Farming

In Zookeeper, the notion of dual farming is introduced which allows the user to farm zoo tokens and wasp tokens (on selected pools) due to the partnership with WanSwap.


## Optional Lock Period

ZooKeeper offers users the possibility of increasing yield farming rewards by using the optional lock period function available for each pool. The longer the period chosen, the more rewards will be given.


## Attach NFT Boost Cards

Extra NFT boost cards are available on ZooKeeper. This unique ability in the crypto market will allow each user to both reduce the locktime and increase rewards. 


## NFT Trading

All NFTs have a possibility to be used or sold in the market section. Selling NFTâ€™s can be done in several cryptocurrencies available on ZooKeeper.


## Governance

ZooKeeper Community will have access to a voting system that will be reviewed by the ZooKeeper team before implementation.


## Burn Mechanic

ZooKeeper has integrated different burning mechanics on its platform to reduce the max supply of ZOO Token.
