In this section, there are several farming pools that allow the user to deposit liquidity and earn rewards. Each pool features an individual zoo animal representing the associated farming pair. Each pool has several functionalities and options (NFT Boost Cards) attached to it including the possibility of reducing locktime and boosting rewards.


## The Expeditions


### Gold & Silver Chests

The user has the possibility of earning chests by either buying them directly using ZOO tokens, or by locking these ZOO tokens. A gold chest will automatically provide the user with an NFT while a silver chest will only give a 1 in 10 chance. All purchased chests automatically burn the ZOO tokens used.


### Magic Spells (Coming soon)
