# Getting Started

![](/availableon.png)

Before you start, you'll need one of the three wallets ZooKeeper supports:

*   WanMask (Desktop)
*   Wanwallet (Desktop/Mobile)
*   Coming Soon: MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile) late APRIL 2021

Once you have a compatible wallet and WSLP tokens (check the FAQ on how to provide liquidity on WanSwap), you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.
