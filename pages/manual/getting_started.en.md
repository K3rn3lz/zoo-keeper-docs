# Getting Started

![](/availableon.png)

Before you start, you'll need one of the three wallets ZooKeeper supports:

*   WanMask (Desktop)
*   Wanwallet (Desktop/Mobile)
*   MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile) https://medium.com/zookeeper-blog/how-to-add-wanchain-and-use-zookeeper-on-metamask-mobile-5ed5a5506631

Once you have a compatible wallet and WSLP tokens (check the [FAQ](/faq#how-to-add-liquidity) on how to provide liquidity on WanSwap), you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.
