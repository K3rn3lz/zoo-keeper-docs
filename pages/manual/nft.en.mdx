# ZooKeeper NFT Information
ZooKeeper NFT's are defined by many key features.  Each minted NFT will have its own individual characteristics.  Some may be the same as others, and some will vary.  For example, no two “Sweet Scented Orange” will be the same:

As you can see from the above, the boosting impact and the locktime reducing impact are different.  Even on the off chance that these should be the same, each NFT will have its individual issue number, making it unique.

When NFTs are minted, the key features which define them will not change.  Boosting and time percentages will not change at any time.

## Level

Levels will make more sense when crafting becomes available. Crafting will provide a mechanism to be able to combine 2 NFTs to create one.  An example of this would be 2 x Apples (2 x 1 stars) = 1 x Apple Juice (1 x 2 star).  This will be possible upto a maximum of 4 levels (One Star, Two Star, Three Star and Max).  More details on this will be provided closer to release time. 

This is the original vision of ZooKeeper team in regards to the level system; more developments will be implemented in the future and changes can be made to the mechanics of this section.
