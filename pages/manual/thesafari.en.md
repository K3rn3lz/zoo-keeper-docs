# The Expedition

The expedition page displays multiple ways to spend or stake ZOO tokens to obtain a "Chest". There are two types of chests: Gold and Silver.

No matter how you manage to obtain it, a gold chest will always contain an NFT Booster. 

A silver chest, however, will have a 1 in 10 chance of winning an NFT Booster. 

NFT are distributed randomly between chests but the rarest NFTs can only be found in Gold chests.

## Buy Gold/Silver Chests:

The option to purchase chests is self-explanatory. You can buy one of either at a time. If an NFT Booster is awarded (remember, silver has a 1 in 10 chance), purchasing will automatically open and add the NFT Booster card to "My Safe".

## Staking ZOO for a Gold Chest:

The alternative option to obtain an NFT Booster is by locking up your ZOO tokens for a set amount of time:
*   2 Days
*   15 Days
*   30 Days

Staking is possible in all 3 pools (2,15,30 day) at the same time.  It's not possible to stake multiple times in the same pool.
