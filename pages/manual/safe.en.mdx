# My Safe
![](/docs/image3.png)

My Safe is an area where your NFT boosters (that have not been utilised in a pool) will reside. Not only will you be able to view the potential these boosters can bring to your WSLP farming pools, but this view will also provide the opportunity for you to sell any unwanted boosters.

Similar filtering options to "The Market" are available here and your transaction history can be viewed and filtered. The page will display how many boosters you own and have in "My Safe".

Each booster will display its associated features, and when hovering over (in card view), you'll see the "sell" button. Right to the left of the sell button you can input the value you wish to sell for, as well as which wan token you will receive upon a successful sale.

Boosters for sale will be identifiable by a large yellow box in the cardâ€™s bottom right.
