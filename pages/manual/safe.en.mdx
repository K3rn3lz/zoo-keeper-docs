# My Safe
![](/docs/image3.png)

My Safe is an area where your NFT boosters (that have not been utilised in a pool) will reside. Not only will you be able to view the potential these boosters can bring to your WSLP farming pools, but this view will also provide the opportunity for you to sell any unwanted boosters.

Similar filtering options to "The Market" are available here and your transaction history can be viewed and filtered. The page will display how many boosters you own and have in "My Safe".

Each booster will display its associated features, and when hovering over (in card view), you'll see the "sell" button. Right to the left of the sell button you can input the value you wish to sell for, as well as which wan token you will receive upon a successful sale.

Boosters for sale will be identifiable by a large yellow box in the card’s bottom right.

## ZOO Burn panel

ZooKeeper has a burn mechanism.  The burn happens every time a chest is purchased.  For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, the burning mechanism will immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens.
## ZooKeeper NFT Information
ZooKeeper NFT's are defined by many key features.  Each minted NFT will have its own individual characteristics.  Some may be the same as others, and some will vary.  For example, no two “Sweet Scented Orange” will be the same:

As you can see from the above, the boosting impact and the locktime reducing impact are different.  Even on the off chance that these should be the same, each NFT will have its individual issue number, making it unique.

When NFTs are minted, the key features which define them will not change.  Boosting and time percentages will not change at any time.

### Level

Levels will make more sense when crafting becomes available. Crafting will provide a mechanism to be able to combine 2 NFTs to create one.  An example of this would be 2 x Apples (2 x 1 stars) = 1 x Apple Juice (1 x 2 star).  This will be possible upto a maximum of 4 levels (One Star, Two Star, Three Star and Max).  More details on this will be provided closer to release time. 

This is the original vision of ZooKeeper team in regards to the level system; more developments will be implemented in the future and changes can be made to the mechanics of this section.
